# Build image
docker/podman build -t linux-cpp .

# Run image
# -it -> interactive, to give a tty to the image
# --rm -> Remove old image (cleanup) since build is going to generate a new one after is executed again
docker/podman run -it --name cpp-dev --rm linux-cpp

# Usually, we want to have code on local machine, for that we need to mount directory
# -v --> for mounting directory in container
docker/podmman run -it --name cpp-dev --rm -v ${PWD}:/develop linux-cpp

# Ideally, we would like to open port or redirect ports
